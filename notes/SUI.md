For bash/zsh (~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc):
    export PATH="/home/dwcks/.local/bin:$PATH"

For fish (~/.config/fish/config.fish):
    fish_add_path /home/dwcks/.local/bin

Then restart your shell or run one of:
    source ~/.bashrc        # for bash
    source ~/.zshrc         # for zsh
    source ~/.config/fish/config.fish  # for fish
